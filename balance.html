        <p class="pb-5">
          The last part of the paper deals with the players' perception of the
          different types of challenges that Roguelite enemies can offer. A
          better understanding of our players' capabilities helps us to design
          their challenges. Moreover, this information is directly related to
          the balancing of the game systems, so it is also very useful for the
          balancing teams in the task of nerfs and buffs to the different enemy
          parameters.

            Perception of difficulty
          </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          Difficulty is a subjective term that depends both on previous
          experience and on the characteristics of the challenge to be overcome.
          Thus, we say that something is difficult when the challenge in
          question exceeds our knowledge and ability to perform it.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          Prolonged time spent with a challenge perceived as too difficult can
          lead to frustration and disengagement with the game. Similarly, when
          faced with challenges perceived as too easy, the player does not feel
          sufficiently excited to continue playing.

              Leaving aside the state of "flow" named in the level design, which
              represents a state of mind of the person in which they are
              immersed and enjoying the experience. We focus on analysing the
              differences in knowledge and skill that our players have when
              facing spatial and temporal challenges.

            Physical capacities
          </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before analysing the knowledge and skills of our players, we must take
          into account certain physical factors inherent to human beings, which
          are an important factor in the performance of some challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-4">
          It seems that certain factors, such as age and gender, are very
          important determinants of visual reaction times and perception of
          three-dimensional space. These abilities are directly related to the
          ease of dealing with the types of challenges posed by some enemies.
        </p>
        <img class="img-fluid w-50 pl-5 pb-4" src="img/reaccion.PNG" alt="" />
        <p>
          According to the study sample shown in this table, there are small
          differences in reaction times when comparing mean times by age, with
          adults of the same sex having around 20ms longer reaction times in the
          case of visual acuity. And there is a similar difference of 15ms in
          the comparison between genders of the same age.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, there is a determining factor in the ability to perceive
          space. The 2013 study of men's and women's brains at the University of
          Pennsylvania concluded that men's and women's brains show different
          connectivity.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-5">
          The study would eventually conclude that there are significant
          differences in the brains of men and women, which would make men
          somewhat superior in the abilities and speeds we are dealing with in
          these types of challenges.

            Objectives
          </h6>
          <p class="pb-4">
            In order to try to support what has been exposed in this work, in
            addition to investigating the capabilities of our players, we put
            into practice some playtesting sessions. Specifically, the aim of
            these sessions is to test different types of players with 2 very
            specific types of challenges: spatial challenges and temporal
            challenges. In order to answer "Which type of challenge is more
            difficult and why?"
          </p>
          <h6 class="text-grey text-uppercase font-weight-bold pb-2">
            Process
          </h6>
          <p class="pb-4">
            A prototype of an enemy and a playable character has been created,
            and throughout the session the user will be challenged with
            different variants of the enemy that will change the challenge in
            question. During the session, the user's performance will be
            monitored and will conclude with a form about the user's perception
            of each enemy.

            Results
          </h6>
          <p class="pb-2">
            Analysing the results obtained to the questions of which enemy they
            found more difficult, we have obtained a clear advantage of the
            enemies that restrict the player's space more, and therefore, a
            greater difficulty of the challenges focused on managing space is
            perceived. There are some exceptions, and it seems to be common
            among adults, better space management versus poorer reactivity, so
            it can be observed that some people find enemies with fast
            projectiles more difficult.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-4">
            An interesting observation, not foreseen in the test planning and
            theory, is that having faster projectiles makes them disappear from
            the player's range in less time, or in other words, the slower the
            projectiles go the longer they stay on screen, thus hindering the
            player more. Therefore, the speed of the projectiles indirectly
            affects the spatial challenge, as the more projectiles the longer
            they are in play, the more difficult the challenge features.
          </p>
          <h6 class="text-grey text-uppercase font-weight-bold pb-2">
            Conclusions
          </h6>
          <p class="pb-2">
            The main conclusion of this playtesting is a clear advantage, in
            terms of perceived difficulty, of challenges with an emphasis on
            reducing space over those with an emphasis on reducing reaction
            times. We therefore conclude that the skills and background
            knowledge of most players, in the area of spatial perception in a
            three-dimensional environment, are less developed than physical
            skills such as reaction times.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2">
            To the question marked in the objectives "What type of challenge is
            most difficult?", we can answer firmly: space challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-4">
            Additionally, it should be added that although not necessarily
            perceived as more challenging challenges, the reduction of relative
            rest times, such as in variant 2 of enemy 1, negatively affects the
            players' performance in overcoming the challenge in the same way as
            the increase in difficulty of the mechanics. This information is
            useful, as we can slow down the player's progress through the levels
            without the player perceiving a drastic increase in difficulty, thus
            decreasing frustration and feelings of injustice.
